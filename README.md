# FDGA

## Project Overview

The Plan:

1. Create a custom ISA to graph a K-means algorithm.

2. Create an optimised compiler to parse C code describing the K-means algorithm into custom ISA language.

3. Use SIMD lanes and multithreading to modify the ISA and compiler to parallelise the operation.

4. Create the interface for the K-means algorithm to allow the user to interact with the K-means algorithm.

5. Multicore parallelism?????
